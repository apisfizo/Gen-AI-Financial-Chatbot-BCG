## 📌 Project Overview
This project was developed as part of the **BCGX GenAI Job Simulation**. The objective was to bridge the gap between complex corporate financial reporting and actionable business intelligence using Generative AI. 

I engineered a pipeline to automate the extraction of key financial metrics and built a conversational AI interface (Chatbot) that allows users to query financial health data using natural language.



## 🛠️ Key Implementation Tasks
During the simulation, I successfully completed the following practical tasks[cite: 6]:
* **Data Extraction:** Developed scripts to parse and extract initial analysis from unstructured financial documents[cite: 7].
* **AI Chatbot Development:** Built a functional, AI-powered financial chatbot designed to interpret complex fiscal data[cite: 7].
* **Business Logic:** Implemented analysis frameworks to identify year-over-year growth, margin trends, and revenue drivers.

## 🚀 Technical Highlights
* **Automated Workflows:** Replaced manual data retrieval with a streamlined AI-driven extraction process.
* **Contextual Intelligence:** Leveraged LLM capabilities to provide summarized insights based on specific fiscal periods.
* **Scalable Design:** Created a modular Python architecture that can be adapted for diverse document-heavy industries.
